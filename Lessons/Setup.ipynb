    "Python is highly important to data science and machine learning. It has many different usages in sciences and here we'll be primarily focusing on using it for machine learning purposes. \n",
    "\n",
    "A few important notes on python is that it is an interpreted and dynamically typed language. Python itself isn't actually something that'll run on your code by default. You'll need to download python to actually be able to use it. When you download python, what happens is it creates a virtual machine layer that creates a layer between the actual code and the platform it runs on. This makes the code highly portable between different platforms. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note**: Before you actually start downloading everything, I highly recommend reading through the rest of the tutorial to figure out what the best way to run python might be for you. First, it's best to read everything and then download things. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple of different ways to run python. Different methods depend on exactly what you'd prefer. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Download it onto your local machine\n",
    "\n",
    "Your 'local' machine is the actual computer you're running everything on. This is the physical computer with no other layers on it. Downloading python on your local device means that you're actually running python. When you download python, it will be able to anywhere on your computer and you'll be able to your computer's already downloaded tools to interact with Python (for example the command line and shell will be able to be used to interact with Python).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The official Python website is: https://www.python.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "To download Python, go to: https://www.python.org/downloads/\n",
    "\n",
    "**Highly recommend** downloading an older version of Python (namely Python 3.7 or Python 3.8). The newer versions have numerous issues that have not been fixed so it is often best to use the older versions that do not run across those issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have press download on the website for the correct Python, you'll recieve a file that you'll need to run in order to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will download Python on your local computer and you can use your shell to even interact with Python. One important thing to keep into mind is that this may not be the best solution for everyone, especially if you want to make sure you're not downloading a lot of stuff onto your computer. If you'd prefer to not download everything onto your own computer, you can look into downloading \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Potential Issues:\n",
    "- A major potential issue if you downloaded Python but it's still not running is that may not be set as PATH. Scroll down below to see how to test it out. If you installed it but it's not working at all, take a look at your PATH variables. Take a look at this to figure out the fix: https://datatofish.com/add-python-to-windows-path/ \n",

    "### 2. Using Anaconda\n",
    "We'll go a bit more into Anaconda later on but this will go over the details on how to download Python using it. The biggest reason to use Anaconda is it enables us to use Conda which is really good for package management and creating virtual environments. Furthermore, Anaconda comes with Spyder as well as has numerous Python data science packages. Spyder is a good way to interact with Python and is a good alternative to VS Code.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3. Using Google Colab\n",
    "Colab may be the easiest way to run Python as it runs on the browser and requires no download. The biggest thing is that when we close our session, nothing is saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about Colab, go to: https://colab.research.google.com/. Colab is a very powerful resource and it's important to know that everytime you run it, you'll need to redownload all the libraries for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing Python Installation\n",
    "To see if Python is working properly, you need to open up a shell, or command prompt and then simply run:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` shell\n",
    "python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This should simply return something that shows you the python version you have and change your shell to show something that looks like:\n",
    "``` shell\n",
    ">>> \n",
    "```\n",
    "And you will be able to enter in python code from there. Try running:\n",
    "``` Py\n",
    "print('Hello World!')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and it should say `Hello World`. If you're using Jupyter Notebook, you can try running the cells and seeing if it works."

An important note is then everytime you disconnect from your Google Colab connection, the notebook will be reset which means any files and libraries imported into Colab will be deleted. This means everytime you use Colab, you'll need to redownload everything you need to run your programs. Google Colab is also only capable of running Python and some functionalities of Python may be somewhat limited.\n",
