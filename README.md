# AI Journal Club
Contains all the content to be used for the AI Journal Club

The upcoming AI journal club will start off every meeting with a small intro to machine learning, deep learning and/or reinforcement learning tutorial. This will include a basic introduction with code. 

Following the instructional time, we'll begin discussions on an actual modern paper. This section is primarily discussion based and will highlight modern papers in the field. 


There will also be time and space dedicated towards project creation.

## How to Use this Repo
### Introudction

### Pre Requisites for thiS Repo
We'll be primarily using Python, PyTorch, VS Code, and Jupyter Notebooks. Prior to coming to the journal club, ensure you have those up and running! Alternatively, you could also use Google Colab. If you plan on downloading PyTorch, we won't be doing anything too intensive to feel free to download the CPU version as the GPU version may come with a slew of difficulties that may be challanging to troubleshoot.

We'll need a couple of additional Python libraries including:
- PyTorch
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

There may be other libraries we download down the line that may be a bit more difficult to install or may simply be optional:
- Pillow
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- Keras
