# AI Journal Club
Contains all the content to be used for the AI Journal Club

The upcoming AI journal club will start off every meeting with a small intro to machine learning, deep learning and/or reinforcement learning tutorial. This will include a basic introduction with code. 

Following the instructional time, we'll begin discussions on an actual modern paper. This section is primarily discussion based and will highlight modern papers in the field. 


There will also be time and space dedicated towards project creation.

## How to Use this Repo
### Introudction

### Pre Requisites for thiS Repo
We'll be primarily using Python, PyTorch, VS Code, and Jupyter Notebooks. Prior to coming to the journal club, ensure you have those up and running! Alternatively, you could also use Google Colab. If you plan on downloading PyTorch, we won't be doing anything too intensive to feel free to download the CPU version as the GPU version may come with a slew of difficulties that may be challanging to troubleshoot.

We'll need a couple of additional Python libraries including:
- PyTorch
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

There may be other libraries we download down the line that may be a bit more difficult to install or may simply be optional:
- Pillow
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- Keras


## Participating in the Journal Club
To take part in the journal club, the best approach would be to fork this repository and add to your own version of this repo as we go. There will be plenty of space for us to fill in information as we go along and you'll also be able to host your projects in your repos as well. 


## Contributions
If you see an error or bug that may need to be fixed, start off by creating an issue for it in GitHub! If you need to fix something, start off by creating a different branch for the issue and create a pull request. Then, request to merge to main and put down a detailed description of the changes in the merge request as well as assign @priyanshumahey as a reviewer to ensure that the changes are allowed.
