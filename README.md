# AI Journal Club
Contains all the content to be used for the AI Journal Club

The upcoming AI journal club will start off every meeting with a small intro to machine learning, deep learning and/or reinforcement learning tutorial. This will include a basic introduction with code. 

Following the instructional time, we'll begin discussions on an actual modern paper. This section is primarily discussion based and will highlight modern papers in the field. 


There will also be time and space dedicated towards project creation.
